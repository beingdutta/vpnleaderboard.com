            <p>
              hide.me is one of the more balanced VPNs in 2025. Whether you’re trying
              the free plan or going premium, you get strong privacy, no logs, modern
              protocols, and a clean experience. The free tier has improved a lot —
              now with better server access, more locations, and solid security tools.
              Premium adds speed, more servers, fixed IPs and port forwarding. If you
              care about privacy without spending too much, hide.me delivers a lot.

            <p class="lead">
              We tested hide.me across multiple devices and networks, home broadband, mobile data, different continents. The premium plans are fast when using modern protocols, and the free version is far more usable than in past years.
            </p>

            <h2>Company Background and Privacy Stance</h2>
            <p>
              hide.me is operated by eVenture Limited, based in Labuan, Malaysia. The company has built a strong reputation for privacy: certified zero-logs, RAM-only servers, and owning much of its infrastructure. While Malaysia may not be the first jurisdiction people think of for VPN privacy, hide.me is very transparent about its policies and operations.
            </p>

            <h2>Performance and Speed</h2>
            <p>
              With premium servers, especially over WireGuard and using the “Bolt” acceleration features, speeds are competitive. Nearby servers feel fast and responsive; long distance or more crowded servers show more lag. Free plan users will notice slower speeds, especially under load or during peak times.
            </p>

            <h2>Security Features</h2>
            <p>
              Core security features include kill switch, leak protection (IP/DNS/IPv6), split tunneling, port forwarding & fixed IP for premium, and in many cases “Stealth Guard” or obfuscation tools. Encryption is strong (AES-256 where applicable), and free & premium share many baseline protections.
            </p>

            <h2>Streaming and Unblocking</h2>
            <p>
              Premium servers generally succeed in unblocking major streaming services like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video. Free servers are less reliable and might struggle with more aggressive geo-blocks. Switching servers helps.
            </p>

            <h2>Ease of Use and Apps</h2>
            <p>
              Apps are cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, browsers. The UI is clean, guides are available, and basic tasks (connect, choose server) are simple. For power users, there are more settings; sometimes differences by OS in which features are available. Free plan has fewer options visible.
            </p>

            <h2>Support and Customer Service</h2>
            <p>
              Support is 24/7 live chat with good documentation and guides. Free users have access to support, but response priority may be lower. Refunds are handled cleanly for paid users, with a 30-day guarantee.
            </p>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
              If you want a VPN that takes privacy seriously, offers a solid free tier, and doesn’t force you into premium for every feature, hide.me is a strong option. It may not always be the flashiest or fastest everywhere, but for everyday privacy, streaming, and value, it delivers more than many expect. If you travel a lot, want ultra-low latency everywhere, or need region-specific unblocking, you may want to compare with other top names—but it should be top-of-mind for the price.
