            <p>
              TunnelBear is the “just works” VPN of 2025. It’s charming, simple,
              and private-by-design, with independently audited apps and an
              unusually generous free plan for casual use. Speeds are fine for
              everyday browsing and Netflix, though it’s less consistent for
              tougher streaming platforms and isn’t the fastest option on the
              market. Unlimited device connections and clean apps make it great
              for households; the main caveat is its refund policy (case-by-case
              rather than a standard 30-day guarantee).

              We used TunnelBear across phones and laptops for everyday tasks:
              browsing, banking, video calls, and some streaming. The experience
              is refreshingly simple—tap the map, connect, and forget about it.
            </p>

            <h2>Company Background and Privacy Stance</h2>
            <p>
              TunnelBear is a Canadian VPN founded in 2011 and later acquired by
              McAfee (it still operates under the TunnelBear brand). The service
              is best known for its annual, <em>public</em> security audits by
              Cure53—covering apps, infrastructure, and the website—plus regular
              transparency notes. In practice: no activity logs, and a strong
              emphasis on clear, human-readable policies.
            </p>

            <h2>Performance and Speed</h2>
            <p>
              With WireGuard enabled, nearby connections felt snappy and stable.
              It’s perfectly fine for UHD YouTube, casual Netflix, and cloud
              backups. That said, long-haul speeds and peak-hour consistency trail
              the very fastest VPNs, so serious gamers or heavy streamers might
              prefer a speed-first provider.
            </p>

            <h2>Security Features</h2>
            <p>
              TunnelBear includes the essentials and a few nice extras:
              VigilantBear (kill switch), GhostBear (obfuscation) for tougher
              networks, SplitBear (split tunneling), and strong encryption over
              modern protocols (WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2). Audited apps and
              a clean design mean less fiddling, more privacy.
            </p>

            <h2>Streaming and Unblocking</h2>
            <p>
              Netflix generally works, but success with Disney+, Prime Video, and
              other platforms varies by server and week. If streaming is your top
              priority, consider a provider with a more aggressive unblocking
              track record; for casual viewing, TunnelBear is OK.
            </p>

            <h2>Ease of Use and Apps</h2>
            <p>
              The map UI is delightfully simple across Windows, macOS, Android,
              and iOS. Setup is quick, and the “Fastest” option does what it
              promises. Unlimited device connections is a genuine perk—install it
              on everything without counting seats.
            </p>

            <h2>Support and Customer Service</h2>
            <p>
              Support is primarily via guides and email. Responses are polite and
              helpful, but there’s no always-on live chat. Also note the refund
              policy: TunnelBear reviews requests individually rather than
              offering a blanket 30-day guarantee.
            </p>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
              Want a private, friendly VPN you don’t have to babysit? TunnelBear
              nails the basics, is transparent about security, and now lets you
              connect <em>unlimited</em> devices. Power users and streaming
              superfans may want more muscle, but for most people, it’s an easy,
              trustworthy pick—especially with that free 2&nbsp;GB plan to try
              before you buy.
