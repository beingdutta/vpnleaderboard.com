            <p>
              PureVPN offers a lot of value in 2025: a large server network, good streaming access, modern features like split-tunneling and dedicated IPs, and multiple audits that back up its no-logs claim. It’s not perfect — some servers are slower, and premium add-ons can bump up the cost — but if you want flexibility and strong privacy without breaking the bank, PureVPN is a solid choice.

            <p class="lead">
              Over several weeks testing PureVPN on home broadband and mobile networks, we found it delivers a lot more than many budget VPNs: good streaming, solid privacy, and strong feature additions. But yes — you’ll pay more (relatively) for extras, and performance varies by location.
            </p>

            <h2>Company Background and Privacy Stance</h2>
            <p>
              PureVPN is owned by GZ Systems Ltd., based in the British Virgin Islands. It has taken serious steps to rebuild trust after past controversies (including a logging case), by updating its privacy policy, commissioning audits (e.g. KPMG), and offering “Always-On Audit” features.
            </p>

            <h2>Performance and Speed</h2>
            <p>
              Use of WireGuard and modern protocols help with decent speeds on many of PureVPN’s servers. Close-by latency tends to be good; long-distance connections see more drop-off. Some servers are very fast, others less so depending on load and geography. If you're streaming, everyday use, or torrenting, it works well — but you’ll notice weaker performance on some servers.
            </p>

            <h2>Security Features</h2>
            <p>
              PureVPN includes standard protections: AES-256 encryption, a kill switch, DNS leak protection, split tunneling, and obfuscation / stealth mode in environments where VPN traffic is blocked. Adds like dedicated IPs, residential IPs, port forwarding and extras are available (often as paid add-ons).
            </p>

            <h2>Streaming and Unblocking</h2>
            <p>
              In our streaming tests, PureVPN generally unblocked Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, and others. Occasional server blocks or geo-issues exist, but switching servers tends to fix things. Premium or optimized servers made a difference.
            </p>

            <h2>Ease of Use and Apps</h2>
            <p>
              Apps are clean, work across Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, routers, and there are browser extensions. The UI is straightforward, though some upsell prompts are frequent. Setup is easy, but advanced features (obfuscation, stealth mode) may require a little reading or tweaking.
            </p>

            <h2>Support and Customer Service</h2>
            <p>
              PureVPN offers 24/7 support in many regions, with live chat and ticket support, plus a knowledge base. Refunds depend on region but generally 31-day guarantee applies on most plans.
            </p>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
              If you’re on a budget but don’t want to compromise privacy, PureVPN strikes a good balance. It’s not perfect everywhere — you’ll see variable speeds, and extras cost more — but its feature set, audit history, and streaming ability make it a compelling choice for many users. If you’re in a region where specific servers are fast, it’s especially worth considering.
