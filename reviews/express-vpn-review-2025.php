            <p>
              ExpressVPN continues to be a top-tier VPN choice in 2025. It
              combines excellent speeds, polished apps, and a privacy-first
              design that remains one of the best in the market. While it carries
              a premium price tag, its consistent performance and independent
              audits ensure that privacy-conscious users get what they pay for.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              We spent weeks testing ExpressVPN across a variety of networks,
              devices, and scenarios to determine whether it still earns its
              reputation. The results show that it remains a leader in speed,
              security, and ease of use.
            </p>

            <h2>Company Background and Privacy Stance</h2>
            <p>
              ExpressVPN is owned by Express Technologies Ltd. and is
              headquartered in the British Virgin Islands, a jurisdiction with no
              mandatory data-retention laws. This legal environment gives the
              company a strong foundation for its strict no-logs policy. Over the
              years, ExpressVPN has repeatedly proven its privacy claims by
              undergoing independent audits and implementing RAM-only servers that
              wipe data upon reboot. This commitment to privacy is especially
              valuable in a landscape where VPNs are increasingly scrutinized.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2024 and early 2025, additional independent audits examined both
              its core infrastructure and its in-house Lightway protocol. Each
              audit confirmed that ExpressVPN keeps no identifiable logs of user
              activity. For privacy-focused users, this repeated third-party
              verification provides peace of mind that marketing claims are backed
              by real practices.
            </p>

            <h2>Performance and Speed</h2>
            <p>
              ExpressVPN is consistently among the fastest VPNs we test. Using the
              Lightway protocol—now open-sourced and reimplemented in Rust—we
              observed near–ISP speeds on local servers and impressive performance
              even on distant connections. Our average download speeds across
              multiple regions remained steady enough for lag-free 4K streaming,
              video conferencing, and online gaming.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lightway’s quick reconnection is another highlight. When switching
              between Wi-Fi and mobile data, it reconnected nearly instantly,
              making it ideal for mobile users who need a seamless browsing
              experience. Whether for remote work or everyday browsing,
              ExpressVPN’s performance remains excellent.
            </p>

            <h2>Security Features</h2>
            <p>
              Security remains ExpressVPN’s strongest suit. All servers operate on
              TrustedServer technology, meaning they run entirely on volatile RAM
              rather than traditional hard drives. This design ensures that all
              data is wiped upon reboot and nothing is written to permanent
              storage. The company also supports secure protocols like OpenVPN and
              IKEv2 alongside Lightway.
            </p>

            <p>
              Features such as a reliable kill switch (called Network Lock),
              DNS/IPv6 leak protection, and split tunneling provide additional
              layers of protection. Lightway itself underwent multiple independent
              security reviews, and its open-source nature lets the community
              continue to vet it for vulnerabilities. For users who require
              airtight security, ExpressVPN delivers.
            </p>

            <h2>Streaming and Unblocking</h2>
            <p>
              ExpressVPN remains a go-to service for streaming enthusiasts. During
              our tests, it consistently accessed Netflix libraries in the U.S.,
              U.K., Japan, and several other countries. BBC iPlayer, Hulu, Disney
              Plus, and Amazon Prime Video worked without issue. Playback was
              smooth and buffer-free, even during peak hours.
            </p>

            <p>
              The company also offers Smart DNS (MediaStreamer) for devices that
              don’t support native VPN apps, such as certain smart TVs and gaming
              consoles. This makes ExpressVPN an attractive option for households
              with diverse streaming needs.
            </p>

            <h2>Ease of Use and Apps</h2>
            <p>
              ExpressVPN’s apps are some of the most user-friendly in the market.
              Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and a range of
              smart TVs and routers, the apps feature a clean interface with a
              single-click connection. The location picker is intuitive, and the
              apps include helpful features like recent location shortcuts and
              built-in speed tests.
            </p>

            <p>
              Setup on routers is straightforward, and the dedicated router app
              allows you to protect all devices on a network with one
              configuration. Browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
              provide additional convenience and secure your traffic with minimal
              effort.
            </p>

            <h2>Support and Customer Service</h2>
            <p>
              ExpressVPN offers 24/7 live chat and email support. In our
              experience, live chat responses arrived within a minute, and agents
              were knowledgeable about technical issues like manual router setups
              and protocol troubleshooting. The support website hosts an extensive
              library of tutorials, making it easy for users to find answers
              without direct assistance.
            </p>

            <h2>Pricing and Plans</h2>
            <p>
              ExpressVPN remains one of the more expensive options in the VPN
              market, with monthly plans typically higher than many competitors.
              However, the company offers discounts for longer subscriptions and a
              30-day money-back guarantee on all plans. The price is justified by
              the service’s reliability, speed, and best-in-class privacy
              features. With up to 10–14 simultaneous connections depending on
              plan and unlimited connections via a VPN router, it offers
              flexibility for individuals and families alike.
            </p>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
              ExpressVPN continues to stand out as a premium VPN solution. Its
              blend of top-notch security, fast and reliable performance,
              extensive streaming support, and intuitive design makes it one of
              the best choices for anyone who values privacy and convenience.
              While cheaper alternatives exist, ExpressVPN’s consistent quality
              justifies the price for those who want a VPN that simply works every
              time.
