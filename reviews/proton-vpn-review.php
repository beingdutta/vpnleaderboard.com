            <p>
              ProtonVPN remains one of the most privacy-focused VPNs you can choose in 2025. With its Swiss jurisdiction, open-source apps, Secure Core routing, and a free plan with **no data caps or ads**, it’s a strong pick especially if you care deeply about transparency and legal protections. Speeds are good, streaming works fine, though if you need ultra-fast gaming or want the absolute top throughput, some rivals are ahead. Still, for most users, the blend of security, features, and ethics makes ProtonVPN tough to beat.

              We put ProtonVPN through our regular mix of tests—streaming, speed, server switching, privacy checks. In many cases, it performs very well, especially when security and transparency matter as much as raw throughput.
            </p>

            <h2>Company Background and Privacy Stance</h2>
            <p>
              ProtonVPN is made by Proton AG, the Swiss company behind ProtonMail. Based in Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland, it’s under Swiss privacy law—which is among the strongest in the world. ProtonVPN has a strict no-logs policy: no tracking of your browsing, no storage of metadata about sessions. It has been independently audited (e.g. Securitum) to confirm those claims. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}

            <h2>Performance and Speed</h2>
            <p>
              Speeds are generally good. On nearby servers and with protocols like WireGuard, you get smooth experience for streaming, video calls, and general browsing. On more distant or crowded servers speeds can drop—but that is common even among VPNs. The free plan gives unlimited bandwidth but with fewer server options and potentially lower priority. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}

            </p>

            <h2>Security Features</h2>
            <p>
              ProtonVPN offers a strong toolkit: kill switch (always on), DNS leak protection, Secure Core which routes your traffic through extra servers in privacy-friendly countries (e.g. Switzerland, Iceland), open source apps so people can inspect code, NetShield blocker for ads/malware domains, and VPN over Tor on higher tiers. These give you more than just the basics. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}

            </p>

            <h2>Streaming and Unblocking</h2>
            <p>
              Yes, ProtonVPN works with Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and other popular streaming services. Sometimes you might need to switch servers if a location gets blocked, but overall streaming quality is solid. It handles geo-restricted content fairly well. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}

            </p>

            <h2>Ease of Use and Apps</h2>
            <p>
              Apps are clean and relatively intuitive across Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and router support. Features like split tunneling are available on some platforms (Windows, Android). The free plan is very usable if you just want privacy and browsing, though lacks many advanced features. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}

            </p>

            <h2>Support and Customer Service</h2>
            <p>
              Support is generally good, but ProtonVPN doesn’t always offer 24/7 live chat everywhere. Their support documentation is solid. Response times vary. Also, because many features are gated behind higher tiers, some users may feel compelled to upgrade to get the full experience. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}

            </p>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
              If you want a VPN where privacy is more than just marketing—where you get open-source apps, verified audits, strong legal protections, and a trustworthy free option—ProtonVPN is among the top choices. It might not be the absolute fastest everywhere, and the paid plans cost more if you go monthly, but for many users, especially those with modest needs but high privacy expectations, it’s an excellent long-term pick.
